# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/tapsalon_icon_200.png
    - assets/images/userImage.png
    - assets/images/volleyball_player.png
    - assets/images/gym.png
    - assets/images/salon.png
    - assets/images/swimming.png
    - assets/images/marker1.png
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    #   - family: Schyler
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
    - family: Iransans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/IRANSansMobile.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/IRANSansMobile_Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/IRANSansMobile_Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/IRANSansMobile_UltraLight.ttf
          weight: 700
